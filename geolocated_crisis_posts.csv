1jmibzg,1743239339.0,depressed after honeymoon in japan due to discrimination so my wife and I be currently in the middle of our honeymoon in japan I pick japan because I use to consider japan my favorite foreign country I like it so much that I choose it as my final work holiday destination year ago and teach myself japanese for that during my time as a work holiday maker I experience racism andor hostility here and there but I could at least hide in plain sight as long as I do not speak too much and no before you even start defend japan like my friend I know some of the hostility be racism because there be japanese customer who turn and walk away once they see my name tag or hear my broken japanese I also hear baka gajin stupid foreigner once or twice just walk down the street with my white friend mind our own business block no one path that say the hostility be still manageable at that time however something happen to I during my honeymoon in japan for my fellow asians who have also be gaslit into think that they re only overthinke or deserve abuse somehow I want you to know that you be not alone anyway I get off a loaded bus in kanazawa and experience something quite shocking and disturbing frankly after week of random hostility and discrimination my love for this country have already be dwindle nonetheless I still hold onto a soft spot for the country in my heart as there have be many wonderful place in japan as well as japanese people who be kind to I this incident however be the last straw that send what be leave of that love down the drain then and there my wife and I do our good to pack light for the week trip so we have a cabin suitcase and a backpack about the same size when we get on the bus it be half empty at kanazawa station because I always make a point of avoid rush hour so that I would not cause trouble to any local however the bus begin to fill up stop by stop and since I realize that ic card be not accept I need to ask my wife if she have enough change in mandarin yes we both have our ticket before you ask we always keep our voice low during the entire trip because we do not want to draw attention or bother people that say I notice that some of the passenger be already stare at we from the corner of their eye I also overhear gaijin foreigner gringo several time on the bus in any case when it be time to get off I have both piece of luggage in hand try my good to get to the front door while apologise in japanese and not bump into anyone excuse I be get off I m really sorry come through there be at least japanese people who would not budge I be utterly stunned and I do not want to be stick there and make everyone wait I know they be japanese because they be talk loudly on the bus they stand in the aisle for a few more second glare at I but eventually yield to we its important that I explain the situation more even though the bus do fill up there be still plenty of seat in the back they do not want to sit down for some reason I also see japaneselooke passenger with much large suitcase they get off the bus without an issue as if it be not depress enough when I tell the bus driver we have no change and show he a yen coin tell he I would pay for the of we he do not look at I or say a single word instead he keep look ahead and point at the cash insertion slot like he be order I to pay and get off I do not even want to use the coin change machine and just pay more than I should ve so that we would not take up more time I ve be do what I can to be a responsible tourist respect the culture and I do plenty of research beforehand still I get treat like crap there be other absurd instance of aggression but this one take the cake for sure overall I m start to feel that japan be go backwards in term of inclusivity when I leave japan year ago I be expect it to open up and become more diverse and accept now I feel its the other way around if you speak japanese and arelook asian brace yourself for some ridiculous stuff before you come I be so look forward to our honeymoon in japan but all these incident have leave a bad taste in my mouth now I panic whenever I have to speak to a japanese person I do not know if heshe will treat I like dirt for no obvious reason,763,0,56,"['I feel for you it use to really hurt my feeling and still do but three year live in asia have make I realize you can not care

live but rather more conservativeless cosmopolitan than some of the more centralmain city yet I have always find the majority of the japanese people here to be very helpful friendly and accommodate I just come back from a business trip to tokyo I have visit a fair few time and have always feel that my city be a well place to live although tokyo be not bad but this time would say there have be a noticeable change in how helpfulaccommodate people in general be there to stranger I guess maybe a rise in tourism and an influx of student or worker into such place have lead to regular becoming jadedfeele more stressed particularly if they have come from overseas and there s a communication barrier as well the worklife balance here have never be good and transportation system for example be run on very tight and rigid schedule that do not accommodate be kind to people who may need extra help I feel that people in general even those who be actually in the service industry be not really willing to take the time to help other out unless they absolutely have to and even then they be less likely to hide their irritation about it than they might have be in the past I and my colleague get in a taxi and the driver say that recently there s be a huge uprise in harassment from customer not just in taxi but everywhere its not just japanese on nonjapanese its japanese on japanese and its on the rise his theory be that there have be a rise in miserable people lately and they be determined to spread the misery when I get back to my city and into a taxi from the airport to my house I be so relieved to get home the driver be very relieved that I could explain where I want to go and give he direction he say that there have be an influx of nonjapanese customer recently and that he s have trouble communicate with they and they have be angry at he all this long story be not to negate your experience or to support it either as only stem from racism what I be hear in general seem to be

be personally direct at you I wish you well', 'I m sorry that this happen to you a lot of people fight and defend japan even when people have valid concern about their disgusting racism and xenophobia

the way I be treat pre and during covid be vastly different than now postcovid I ve have more incident of xenophobia than ever and have have place try to charge I tourist price or give I shit service or ppl openly hostile etc despite speak japanese I think because of some rude shitty tourist its trigger that underlying racism to bubble up racism have always be here its just more apparent now with the general anger and frustration of a more crowded noisy japan and crash yen maybe because I ve live here for so long but idgaf and continue about my day you really should not let it get to your feeling or let it hurt you people be people everywhere japan be not some magical utopia its get its proscon just like every country', 'sorry to hear that such experience have ruin your honeymoon I be an asian american live in japan now while it do not happen that often I have and still also experience discrimination similar to yours when I m work people would ask for a japanese person when they

nothing wrong and maybe its just I but I be start to see an uptick of open hostility towards foreigner mostly from japanese netizen though like when I read a news article online from yahoo news japan about some recent crime and you look through the comment its pretty likely you ll always find a comment blame foreigner or people automatically assume the perpetrator be a foreigner grant its yahoo
