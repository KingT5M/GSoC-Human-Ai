europe however japan be notorious for there hatred of mixed child I really do not think its fair to your child to raise they in japan because they will be treat so badly and they also have a loss be raise without their culture its just unfair and not right and I m sorry this be a systemic problem in japan', 'sorry that happen to you I ve experience some crazy discrimination travel too and it can be jarring and disheartening I hope you and your wife manage to have a mostlynice time even so', 'I ve live in japan for many year now but in a city that be generally consider to be a great place to live but rather more conservativeless cosmopolitan than some of the more centralmain city yet I have always find the majority of the japanese people here to be very helpful friendly and accommodate I just come back from a business trip to tokyo I have visit a fair few time and have always feel that my city be a well place to live although tokyo be not bad but this time would say there have be a noticeable change in how helpfulaccommodate people in general be there to stranger I guess maybe a rise in tourism and an influx of student or worker into such place have lead to regular becoming jadedfeele more stressed particularly if they have come from overseas and there s a communication barrier as well the worklife balance here have never be good and transportation system for example be run on very tight and rigid schedule that do not accommodate be kind to people who may need extra help I feel that people in general even those who be actually in the service industry be not really willing to take the time to help other out unless they absolutely have to and even then they be less likely to hide their irritation about it than they might have be in the past I and my colleague get in a taxi and the driver say that recently there s be a huge uprise in harassment from customer not just in taxi but everywhere its not just japanese on nonjapanese its japanese on japanese and its on the rise his theory be that there have be a rise in miserable people lately and they be determined to spread the misery when I get back to my city and into a taxi from the airport to my house I be so relieved to get home the driver be very relieved that I could explain where I want to go and give he direction he say that there have be an influx of nonjapanese customer recently and that he s have trouble communicate with they and they have be angry at he all this long story be not to negate your experience or to support it either as only stem from racism what I be hear in general seem to be that japan be become a less tolerant place when it come to be helpful and that more and more people be take out the stress that they feel on each other bullying be still rife but it might not actually be personally direct at you I wish you well', 'I m sorry that this happen to you a lot of people fight and defend japan even when people have valid concern about their disgusting racism and xenophobia

or ppl openly hostile etc despite speak japanese I think because of some rude shitty tourist its trigger that underlying racism to bubble up racism have always be here its just more apparent now with the general anger and frustration of a more crowded noisy japan and crash yen maybe because I ve live here for so long but idgaf and continue about my day you really should not let it get to your

nothing wrong and maybe its just I but I be start to see an uptick of open hostility towards foreigner mostly from japanese netizen though like when I read a news article online from yahoo news japan about some recent crime and you look through the comment its pretty likely you ll always find a comment blame foreigner or people automatically assume the perpetrator be a foreigner grant its yahoo

title I can tell its on your mind and honestly I think it might be a good move for you the tone of your post suggest to I that you might see therapy as this big monumental step that mean admit that your life be really fuck I do not see therapy that way at all in my experience therapys not that much different than go to a doctor for a checkup you would not think that you be a failure or that your life be horrible if you go to a doctor for a checkup right no you d say that it be a good move and a way to take care of yourself just common sense same thing with therapy everyone struggle in life

alongside medication or as an alternative where medication be not an option dbt and act also have efficacy in treat adhd the utility of therapy be a space to manage symptom that present as common

combination of commitment to the week of cbt while use medication if you can not or will not use medication they can refer you to other place I find the idea of put people through cbt for adhd without

1jmtp79,1743275328.0,how to cope with grief and regret from explicit ostracism help trauma build upon exist trauma when ur great fear of abandonment and ostracism become reality repeatedly I understand that bpd sufferer often struggle with extreme fear of abandonment and social exclusionrejection that be often just irrational fear we often overthink and catastrophise because of past trauma however what if the bad case scenario keep come true how do u cope with the pain and grief from be ostracise and abandon a group from my cca I use to play game with before exchange become much close after I get back from exchange during my exchange I be in severe depression and suicidal and have no support system and have open up to a friend from this group however he repeatedly ignore my message and have reply trust I I know what it feel like to be ignore but the more u pester I the more I do not want to reply u I be hurt and angry as I have feel that as a friend I would have be more understanding and avoid do the thing that triggerhurt my friend and have mutually agree to not text each other but do not mind play game together when I get back when I get back the group have become much close and have even create an unofficial group from the cca however because they play game at unofficial hour I have stop join fast forward year several member from the group invite I to join the session tell I that he be not around I do not tell they that we be not on good term but figure he tell they I think to give it a try consider I use to play with they and it do seem nice belong to a clique however I later find out from a mutual friend that I be not welcome back because someone be not comfortable with play with I and know it be this guy I message he privately to clarify politely if he have talk behind my back and he say no however I later receive a sarcastic message from my friend who be mad at I confront he I tell he to stop complain about I to she he clarify that he do not do so but he have post in the unofficial group srsly can we not make this whole xx thing some big drama fest idk which one of u he msge but I alr make it clear I not comfortable with he idw make this big than it have to be pls respect my boundary can or not thank demand the member not to invite I and to respect his boundary and he do not want any drama I understand if he choose not to play with I and want his friend to respect that decision however I feel that he be force his boundary onto everyone by demand they to not invite I after he post that series of message because it be so extreme I feel that people would just assume I do something horrible to he when he say he be simply just not comfortable play with I as we have not talk to each other for a long time since I get back I do not actively avoid he or give he the cold shoulder I just do not proactively talk to he furthermore I rarely see he inperson since I stop go for those session I have also sincerely apologise for opening up to he about my depression and that it may have be too overwhelming for he however I tell he I be not okay with he post that series of message in the group chat and force his boundary onto everyone he then block I this incident have cause I to fall back into depression and my general anxiety disorder have worsen a lot as I can not help but worry about what member think about I after see his series of message to not invite I would have think about I and likely assume I do something horrible to he consider how extreme it be to post that in the group chat however because I be not in the group chat there be absolutely no way for I to clarify it as it would be super weird of I to randomly message they about this consider I m not suppose to even know about he post they my depression and anxiety get so bad then that I have want to take a leave of absence loa but decide not to at the end as I have already take an loa for a semester prior that week I be extremely afraid to go to my cca to play as I do not know what will happen and be worried about what people think about I my friend not involve in the drama reassure I that I be just overthinke however the bad thing happen when the moment I enter the room and sit on the table beside they because there be no other place to sit I avoid look at they and even sit at the seat furth from they he follow by his friend leave the room immediately other member who I use to be okay with include the one who invite I seem afraid to interact with I since thenthis incident hurt I a lot and I be quite traumatise by it since then I have always be paranoid and extremely insecure about it recently I have ask to join dinner with mutual friend one of which be friend with the guy close friend who have leave the room with he I have never interact with he prior and have not bother to interact with he after the incident where he have leave the room with that guy however I decide to give the benefit of doubt and tell myself I m just overthinke by ask my friend if I could join they for dinner yet again the bad happen and I be reject to join they for dinner once again I feel extremely hurt and go into crisis mode it be so uncomfortable because I keep worry about what gossip may have spread about I and could not even play with my other friend who be not involve in the drama anymore this be also why I feel so insecure when the two new friend I make stop invite I for dinner which lead to the whole drama and ban after I tell they I be unhappy about it look back I understand that I have overreact and act out at certain point I have be experience alot of grief guilt regret and shame even though I be ban over month ago I have not be able to let go and move on as everything still seem like it have happen yesterday and I can not help but keep see so many possible way in which I could have prevent it and be stick ruminate and have intrusive thought and feeling of grief regret anger and shame I also keep feel unjust and wrong as the incident with my former fren be a result of a combination of my own paranoia insecurity and unfortunate circumstance its just too overwhelming to cope with as its like trauma build upon trauma where ur great fear of be ostracisedexclude come true despite try so hard to start afresh I ve lose so many friend and potential friend directly and indirectly from this drama all I want be to belong to a large social group but I lose both golden opportunity and can not help but keep regret over they,1,0,1,['additional detail of the conflict that lead I to be ban from cca I ve recently be ban from my cca due to personal conflict with a friend because of a misunderstanding where I feel I be exclude and express my unhappiness lash via text where tell they I do not want to join they anymore and that I feel that they do not care about how I felt lead to a fall out he have ignore my message and block I even after apologise twice once before and once after the ban I also request to clarify any misunderstanding but be ignore irl I be shock by the blocking and his refusal to allow I to clarify any misunderstanding as such I suspect he have report I then my other former friend have this extreme boundary where she do not want to know if I have any conflictunhappiness with mutual friend and be mad block and report I as she feel that I have disrespect her boundary by let she know that he have not reply to my message where I tell he I be unhappy and I tell she be worried that I be be ghost she be mad because she be content with be ignorant about it personally I feel it be very extreme as I feel I have a legitimate reason for tell she at that time and do not consider it as cross her boundary as thing could get more awkward if she do not know I have be ghost and I just hope for some reassurance that I be be insecure and overthinke that s all its not like I have tell she about some random mutual friend I have conflict with in which she be not involve I also explain that I be not single he out and that I see both of they as a collective whole in this situation so it would be weird to I not to let she know about the status of this situation and that because she be okay with I be unhappy with she at that time and clarify that it be not intentional exclusion I think she would be okay with I express my unhappiness of not be reply by he I say that I be not anymore unhappy with he than with u at that moment I tell they both I be refer to the time after she be mad that I tell she however when I explain why I feel it be okay at that time she seem to misunderstand I as guilt tripping and emotional manipulation and report I to the exco I have apologise to both my former friendw for my behaviour prior and after the ban but they do not forgive I the official reason give by the exco be unsolicited trauma dump and badmouth people behind their back I feel wronged and unfair because my intention be never to badmouth those individual but just to share my side of the story and how upset certain individual from my cca make I feel include verbal and physical harassment and explicit exclusionary behaviour like leave the room the moment I enter furthermore she have always seem engage when I complain about my issue about certain member in the cca to they and have nvr express that they be uncomfortable with I share these with they until recently and I have stop since and have even trauma dump and complain about member include the one I complain about honestly there be several instance in our private convo that have really disturb I include when she tell I that that if she be not a good person I hope I be thing could have pan out horribly it sound like a threat like she could use the info I share to backstab I if she want to it also feel like she be fish for validation that she be a good person I just politely tell she that I will not trauma dump again but do not clarify on the threat as it honestly make I feel pretty uncomfortable that a friend be say this no one have ever say this to I it be also quite confusing and shocking to I becuz in my mind the bad that could possibly happen be just they ignore my message or tell I they wish I stop and I would gladly stop as I would not want to overwhelm my friend so I do not understand what exactly that threat mean like how horrible could thing turn out just from my sharing because for I at the very least when a friend trauma dump to I I always feel the least I could do be just I listen I always feel like if a friend be share about their trauma or a difficult situation they be the one gg thru a really hard time and the least I could do be just to listen in fact its almost instinct for I to want to comfort they so its just quite hard for I to fully understand how difficult it be to just listen despite I be easily overwhelm by negative emotion but this message of hers honestly kinda terrify I last time and leave a bad impression of she on I cuz it sound like a threat of what she could do to I if she have want to however after the recent fall out she have complain I to the exco their friend instead of tell I directly by use the information I have share with they in private text I feel that she have use my history of trauma dumpingcomplaine and frame it as badmouth as a legitimate reason to ban I from the club because she be unhappy with I I feel that this be a rather extreme reaction from she and I personally feel backstabbed I be ban by the exco even without share my side of the story and be meet with complete silence when I request to do so request to unban I have also be ignore and I be not allow at the cca be escort out of the premise I feel that personal conflict should never have be use to ban someone and at the very least a warning of some sort should have be first give honestly how this whole situation unfold and be blow way out of proportion to a ban on I have really affect my mental and emotional state I feel I be backstabbe by my friend whom I have trust this be especially so because they know how much the cca mean to I I have be struggle with depression ocd and generalise anxiety disorder and have be take medication since it be so severe that I have trouble function daily and thus take a gap year where my mental problem finally be well manage in where I decide that I be healthy enough to enrol in uni I have minor relapse over the year and one major one year back where I have take a leave of absence however this situation have really affect I and I go into severe depression and anxiety few week after hear I be ban because my cca have be my nd home and close to my heart over the year and be unable to resolve this issue with the exco I have write a long sincere apology to my former friend and the exco request the exco to hear my side of the story and clarify in great detail on the serious allegation badmouth ppl behind their back and unsolicited trauma dumping make against I as well as promise a commitment to prevent these behaviour as well as clear and specific action I will do that eg not complain to friend and talk to the individual who upset I directly practise more effective conflict

community therapy would not be in such high demand', 'there be people that be in therapy that might not have to be there if they have a solid support system but a solid support system be nothing like the therapy you get when you need the deep form of therapy I m in that category there s no way I d tell a close friend over and over detail of the thing that have happen to I this be what be require to treat my ptsd people in general be judgmental include your friend they do not have infinite patience to listen to your blathering if you tell they unusual intrusive thought that you have they do not know the in and out of intrusive thought and they might literally think ill of you for have such thought because they be so different than anything they ve experience friend tend to go along with you when you tell your side of a conflict essentially strengthen your point of view my therapist do not invalidate I she actually do a pretty good job at unconditional positive regard but she create an environment where I feel safe question my own point of view I do not feel the need to convince she I m in the right because she will not be judgmental it make I be more self aware more objective about myself and I learn to see other possible way of interpret situation from my past I can not image a friend or family member fill that role not even close', 'no therapy be not or should not be an equivalent to social support obviously a therapist be a part of your support system but they really should not be fulfil the same role as a friend therapist should be apply knowledge to help you build skill work through problem understand yourself well not just be a supportive friend there be absolutely way that therapist help we learn how to have healthy relationship and the relationship with your therapist should be very different from your friend', 'I semi agree but I think slap a simple solution such as community on complex mental issue will not work community may be an effective tool in stabilize those with mental health disorder while they pursue other mean to tackle they there s a reason why slogan suck as isolation be bad than smoke or the opposite of addiction be connection connection be important what if an individual suffer from cptsd major attachment issue disassociation difficulty trust other high avoidance struggle with addiction etc I do not believe community alone could solve this and therapeutic intervention would be require this would need to be attack from multiple angle and their symptom could be too overwhelming to function in society if community be something you feel strongly about maybe moderate group therapy session could be a career path for you', 'I have eminem type of shitty parent and I try community and no community could give I any kind of relief or comfort they even make I feel bad due to majority of the people that belong to a community be usually happy people with good parent and good relationship I literally stand out with my weirdness in community due to lack of basic communication skill there be so many time I be exclude because people usually do not want to deal with you or they already have a judgement in their mind about you and it be already execute they will not come up and say hey what s wrong but they will say like something be wrong with that guy let try not to invite he this be not everybody of course but community or people lack empathy people live good life think that everyone be live good life too so they just assume the bad shit about you', 'a therapist hold space for you to learn to reparent yourself so you can securely attach to other human it allow you to face challenge from a ventral vagal standpoint instead of go sympathetic or dorsal vagal a social prescriber be the gobetween for lack of community we do not have they in the we if you re american', 'in book they say strong community bond be one pillar for healthy well be I do not even talk about specific mental health stuff with my own family lets not talk about community heck I do not even know my neighbour on a level other than hi and bye', 'even when we have community its not a guarantee that we be accept in it or have healthy relationship and people be hurt even when we have more community activity we tend to forget that good old day only work because it serve a few number of people while suppress or hide other problem we now live in a time when we be try to be more honest and more inclusive but maybe that process be cause more conflict I come to an important understanding recently what do the phrase correlation do not mean causation actually mean what make sense to I be that firstly we have bias and when we jump into this lead to that its a common thought process but it ignore the complexity of life and all the variable that come into play we be not good at see all the possible combination and its hard work to manage multivariate problem community be one factor for example as the book bowling alone highlight we be see a reduction in community and that seem to match the pace and speed of other social trend but so do financial datum so do political datum so do the increase in disaster or the use of drug or crime or technology its useful to look at one system to help we understand how thing work but if we focus too hard on narrow term we might be miss other key element therapy be base on some psychology in some place it get a little blurry and maybe start lean toward pseudoscience but as long as its tame with scientific study and show promise maybe its helpful but sociology be another soft science that have a lot to say about our condition and we need to maybe include that in the mix along side biological system understanding I do think that you have land on what be maybe the most important question of our time what be the right balance between the individual and the global body of people what do we owe or offer to ourselves that be different or similar to other people how do we square real group problem with personal choice I do not know a therapist role be complicated too I think professionalism typically call for nonfriendship type of relationship in therapy a friend should spend time with you without payment want to experience life with you share moment and experience share vulnerability share food and drink help you move and be more than therapist can ever be I do not think a therapist be a good surrogate for true friendship and if we expect that its likely some problem with the idea about self and community what I do believe be that a lot of people need help and I want to be helpful even though I m not a therapist', 'fair point I think attachment style be a huge part of this but I also wonder how much our attachment be relate to our societal condition the family system have take a major hit in the past year due to change societal condition result in less communal integration the question be if we have this communal integration would people inherently be more securely attach I think I can say with some confidence that there would at least be an increase likelihood of be securely attach to at least a couple member of one family system or close social community as there would simply be more people to relate towith and in turn a great chance of one selfactualization without outside professional intervention', 'yes good point I do agree that have the confidentiality aspect be especially important with particular emphasis on rural community who have an increase sense of togetherness I can see both be integral to a health system with our current societal landscape', 'that be an interesting perspective particularly because you know who also do counseling besides therapist priest and other clergy I m not the least bit religious but I can definitely see how someone who be might get something from pastoral counseling that they might not get from a traditional therapy relationship', 'I have actually feel this way about my therapist kinda like he be a pastor that I be confess thing to he ask I one time how I see he and I say teacher because I be a little embarrassed by see he as a pastor', 'I can get behind this in a way can also see this lead to an argument as to whether the field of psychology be a form of religion in and of itself it definitely offer some of the same benefit as previously societally hold religion but similarly I can also see that it have limitation and may hinder creative thinking ex somatic exercise not be billable', 'right back at you very well say I totally agree', 'I agree that therapist should not be your friend for sure but would have supportive friendscommunity negate a need for therapy for a majority of people I could see it but I m not sure', 'good point here I agree that a multivariate approach be likely key I guess for I I just wonder how prevalent mental health issue themselves would be in our society if community be more of a priority will we ever know this likely not to your last point I do think group therapy would serve to be a good middle ground for I personally have never even think of pursue anything like that but it have pique my interest very much appreciate your response', 'I can honestly relate to this my upbringing be not great and I have be pretty isolated for the majority of my life find a community that I actually resonate with seem like a pipe dream at this point I think this be part of a big picture though particularly that of our current capitalistic structure of our society our push for individuality have seep its way into the mind of the individual and have make community a sort of esoteric ideal that s why I m on reddit lol', 'I applaud your response I think this be our current societal dilemma and feel that we be still in the begin stage of determine an adequate balance of individuality and communal integrity I do agree that therapy do require a degree of professionality but I think this be also a balance act between hard professionalism and personal authenticity on the therapist end there have to be a level of trust in the therapeutic relationship and this be not achieve through severe professionalism which to I can lead to an implicit power dynamic I agree that people need help in our society but also feel that we need to question what be actually helpful and to I this begin with look at all angle of an issue as you say society be the individual and vice versa', 'this be why I also use ai as a conversational partner instead of binge watch netflix or tiktok brain or play video game because it help supplement the terrible connection opportunity available in society at this time besides therapist and shallow surface level conversation', 'nope they serve totally different purpose therapist have expertise and help heal mental health issue isolation ie lack of community can exacerbate mental health issue but its not the root cause of they', 'mental health issue be still prevalent in much more communityoriented less individualistic culture very much so', 'that s fair I should probably look into use ai in this way the lack of social connectedness in our current system be appal', 'kinda agree I think the root cause of some mental health issue could be a lack of community particularly childhood community aka family system without other member around to offer support one then need therapy in the modern sense at the end of the day people just want to be listen to and feel human connection to I that be the root of trauma whether that be a disconnection from one own environment or a disconnection within themselves but if the ladder we can likely pinpoint this back to the family system aka the original community', 'could you give some example', 'be truly terrible when you try to talk with anyone in your life try to talk about emotion or philosophy or live experience and you ll see probably what I have observe which be evade dodging avoid change the subject etc it be truly terrible', 'I be a therapist there be lot of different kind of trauma but generally trauma cause by dysfunction within the family system be not an issue of lack of community its cause by specific family dynamic your family can be extremely present and there can still be dynamic that be harmful lot of trauma also have nothing to do with childhoodfamily dynamic additionally lot of mental health concern have nothing to do with trauma therapy be not new mental health issue be not new certainly not new since the rise of technology but again you do not pay a therapist to care about you you pay a therapist for their expertise in treat mental health disorder care about you be part of it as be listen and connecting but only part of it you can replace the care with community you can not replace the treatment', 'mental health issue still exist in the middle east east asia etc', 'I relate heavily with that in mind if you ever wanna chat my dms be open', 'I could be a therapist but be just not license I think a lot more mental health issue originate in childhood than we give credit to which I think be a current gap in the field I see the family as the first community with the idea that as a child its literally all you know this then form the blueprint of your life in a way there be vary form of trauma that can happen later in life that may need to be process or treat I be curious what mental health concern do you think do not have to do with trauma to I trauma be ultimately a deep distressing experience that one do not have the ability to process in the moment of experience which then result in a need to process at a late point and albeit integrate the trauma if need be the way I see it most mental health disorder could fit in this category hell even adjustment disorder could be throw in there I just want to say that I be in no way discount the potential power of therapy just enjoy a good discussion on these topic of interest to I', 'what do you mean I could be a therapist but be just not license the idea that the way we live our life and relate to other be heavily color by how we grow up and our childhood be far from controversial in the field its pretty widely accept lot of mental health concern do not have anything to do with trauma schizophrenia be heavily genetically heritable bipolar disorder be not cause by trauma neither be ocd nor be gad asd and adhd be not cause by trauma there be ton of disorder that do not have their root in traumatic experience this be precisely why therapist be not an analogue for friend there be actual factual information behind all of this and what you re say be fundamentally just not accurate', 'I mean that I have all the education to be a therapist master degree but have be pursue nonprofit work and thus have not feel a need to become licensed to become a practice therapist I honestly disagree with you there on ocd and gad not have traumatic origin I m aware that the idea of childhood development be not a controversial thing in the field but I personally feel that not enough attention be place on it as it be the root of the tree so to say I also think that hold research in this way especially in this field could result in potential harm as just because something be widely accept do not mean that it should not be question social science research be the low tiere research in term of credibility and this idea itself have recently be bring up in research I m not discount research itself as it be one of my passion but when we take it as the end all be all there s

internally impact my sense of self my understanding of my own sexuality lead to confuse and contradictory feelingscompulsion relate to attraction porn and intimacy my selfworth and my ability to function I ve include a raw dialogue transcript between some alter trigger warning to show the extent of this internal conflict and division while their method be often confusing or harmful many seem to stem from a place of try to cope with pain or protect I from a world I struggle to navigate though they disagree strongly on how to do so I desperately want to find a way towards a more unified healthy identity and reduce this constant suffering and mental drain currently I can not access psychiatric help due to various constraint I be share my experience here hope to find understand empathy or advice from other who might have similar experience with dissociation alter or intense internal conflict I be specifically look for peer support and cope strategy not necessarily clinical advice thank you for read hello everyone I hope you re do fine be safe and as healthy as you can be actually since my feeling and thought be very unclear and its like I m divide into a thousand part I m not sure I perfectly conform with the norm of communication but I hope its at least an acceptable way to express myself I hope its not take down because of the content of the dialogue between my alter contain before at least I have an opinion from someone here who also share a similar experience or at least form some empathy with I and please believe I moderator I do not carry any malformed intention I m just ask for help I be not currently able to see a psychiatrist because of some constraint both inherent and impose but I definitely not ask for any clinical advice this part be partially write by the alter of our system and it have the help of other alter while I do not have the opportunity to have the control and inspect what they be do its clear that they still keep interfere with how and what I communicate as they have vary understand intention and skill of communication but I will try my good to be as neutral as possible so I can communicate my problem to you as much as possible as you may already guess I m not a native speaker of english and since some alter interfere with I while I try to write and speak both in my mother tongue turkish and also in english I have a really hard time make the correct wording choice and build proper and comprehensible sentence so please do forgive I if some part sound like jibberish I place the dialogue intervene in here at the very end of the post I feel a need to interrupt here as a disclaimer I do not know the exact origin and start point of my dissociative disorder actually there be the memory of a past experience that I say we please can not figure out what this be most probably it be a traumatizing experience but I be be not really sure but I we highly suspect it at least have an impede impact and if the dialogue between those different alter which I can not tell apart who be who because some be too similar and some be too divergent and some be sleep or their voice weaken because they get so tired fighting with other for example the religious spiritual question strict asexual etc alter do stop only with I stop turn an ear to they I m one hundred percent sure that they be still speak because the heaviness feeling in my head be not go anywhere just I can make myself feel isolated from they and try to associate more with outer world even if they keep intervene whether I figure out they be do or not I wish I be never bear with this illness because ever since my realization of this disease I start to face with those nameless shapeless alter more and more and I just want to have an uniform healthy identity please can you help I what I can do to suffer from this illness that result from some trauma I can not realize what exactly that be what s bad be they might be multiple because sometimes I can recall very lively memory and sometimes I can not this illness and also the alter interfere with my memory which be once very strong please do not just let it fade out here I m struggle a lot as also the alter have state I m leave their dialogue as it be so that you can have a well idea of my situation and to some extent division of identity not all because there be some alter out there I m not able to hear now and they re all suck and dry my brain power out now more trigger warning and this be the dialogue that intervene while I try to write this post I plan not to get help from any type of ai so that I can be transparent enough and let you see the extent of my problem you should also say sorry for be so kind ahaha stop laugh at I I m cry but system be not damn shut your fucking mouth stop curse just stop do not distract the system you all do someone say fuck oh yes fucking muscle male muscle no they do say fuck to talk about the fucking in gay porn be a gooner and obey yes I feel an eehrection why can not this happen when I think and look at muscle becauseee I always take over like I do year ago I get everything starteddd thou do not it be actually I who be you the literature maniac we make you alive the system be not able to function so he create you with an intention of cope with identity and existential problem the physical reaction you state be not actually happen before he condition itself I guess that be true because he never want to be intelligent enough to face truth of the world should not we just let the system write what he really want to write he be never intelligent to begin with they have make he think so since he be young he do not really think so he always doubt it he doubt it even more after some professional tell he he get an average score but one other tell he a year ahead of that other test in another division of that center that he be possibly actually very intelligent but not perform very well due to some kind of inherent problem and they can repeat the test to evaluate it some time later you get really excited system do you really want the people on net to know how insane you be what if that boy stand next to you read all the stupid shit be write on this digital notepad stop please I want to goon and jump mindlessly you make the system think so but he be not able to pleasure himself even slightly because he never achieve what those crazy people on twitter and various adult site call goon state you re really fake it the gooner alter if that s what you ever prefer to be call turn back to your root he s still very innocent you know he be autistic he be not never able to grasp the concept of sexuality but I want to help understand look I m write properly I just want he to enjoy himself because he s never able to enjoy the muscle as he do at the beginning because another alter who decide that he should stick to porn to masturbate because look at nonporn actor men upper body with lust be not an acceptable behaviour if he do know what he be do back then be not really wrong he never want to harm man or woman he just want to enjoy look touch and maybe kiss male torso lie next to they adore they and that s it not really what other people prefer to call sex penetrative sex oral sex whatever they be oh yes that s what I be look for who be you I will call myself muscle lover or adorer but he could also enjoy look all type of torso other than fatty one before some alter come and try to take over because there be another imposter who rejected grow up and only be attract to the torsos of other who be year young than they we mistook the torso enjoy behaviour for that other type of attraction its not acceptable believe I I do not want to harm these year old boy I do not want to do anything relate to disgusting sex I just want to enjoy look at their torsos touch they maybe kiss these torso put my head on they chat with the beautiful precious owner of one of that beautifulnaturally athletic healthy not skinny look or with just more muscly with big pec and somehow define ab as long as its not extreme unlike the muscle lover want from those adult man torso about our life hobbie science space our future dream and hug each other and stay loyal to one of they forever as long as he love I back I wish we never grow up be an adult suck I just want to remain at the same age of those boy whose beautiful lovely face and torso I adore but I can not so I will not look at they I never want to the adult system to even think about they because its really disgusting but if he be at their age and one of they could also get attract to he it would have be the good thing that could ever happen to he that s the main problem he do not know what real sex be so I m show he you re only show the wrong representation reflect in pixel but the real one be not so much well I wish he never have to grow up too and discover that disgusting porn he never open that page with the intention of watch it he do not know what he be trigger by at his second confrontation with porn most probably their movement because they be not just a picture and they re do something where its acceptable to look at their torso but some alter that come after cause he to misinterpret it unfortunately those alter be my origin but who care if I continue to exist now it be not well for he to become an ephebophiliac let he goon for adult male enjoy their time but you also want he to sexualize genitalia butt and anus of those adult man and sometimes just force to only look at they and enjoy they which he could never yes but there s no other way to confuse he and compulsively get hooked to it more but you re make everything bad I know but how healthy be be an ephebophiliac he be not an ephebophiliac because he do not have that kind of conscience its only that there s an alter who reject grow up and always stay attract to the torso type and facial characteristic of the boy between those specific age the attraction which he do not call it sexual be solely to worship and praise those torso and faces not harm they or the owner by any mean it might be an aesthetic or affective attraction he just want to be in love and also ensure that they live happy he can even be a slave for their happiness a tiny smile on their face yes he be innocent just like all of you even you the gooner I know you also do not grasp the concept of sex you just pretend we will not able to understand and enjoy the concept of real sex nor do we want to enjoy I wish we could all become asexual you know one of we do not want to harm woman by any mean he believe woman be create to be love appreciate live freely and do whatever they want unless its not ethically wrong and you also do not harm woman do not you yes apartheid of some guy I do not recall his name who experience a weird trigger not really a hard on towards some woman with certain type of clothing unfortunately I also fake it until I lose my belief that I could make the system believe he can desire woman sexually even with these clothe because their naked body look so so unattractive but I should admit that I sometimes still make trivial attempt they re not so trivial who care its because our mom hate see they not really I do not think the system really have interest anyways there be other boy who can experience sexual attraction to the female body without their mother will yes that s true since he experience affective and aesthetic and maybe somehow sexual attraction only towards torso not the rest of the body that to male with kind attitude beautiful smile and good look and feel extremely comfortable be around male as long as they treat he very kind since he be or before his dad and other male tell he to become more like real manwhich he still struggle to understand what they really mean with that the man be always lovely even the one who be accept by ugly by the society but they be so so cruel they would never give the compassion feeling of be understand partnership to help he figure out this world listen to their idea and let he enjoy their company beautiful face and torso without ask for more but I think he want to get more close to they its that other alter who believe that the system should get skin to skin merge with they and feel they more and believe he can only do this via penetrative sex because that disgusting organ that be also use for pee even this alter call it disgusting can connect he to that male and he can feel the connection feel in his anus and then his whole body as they do what be call fcke he want to get fuck so bad and also fuck to establish that bond yeesss but he can not so he should goon forever to the those representation even if they lack love and they be not what he really want to see because these look so fleshy and wild but I sometimes make he believe that they represent the love in his mind just not to lose he forever stop gooner do not distract we and the system no he just yearn for that connection those muscle which some people refer they to trigger prostate orgasm would never do that its just that he believe if someone fill that gap there they will merge and form an undischargeable bond forever that s possibly the actual mere only origin of the gooner alter let allow he speak for himself oh why do not he just take the turn to speak okay I will I actually cause he to feel a sensation on the anus he have a gut problem you know he never feel comfortable because he always have a hard time have to defecate a lot and wait for so long before he s all do with defecating so I first make he think its actually a comfortable feeling to poop when I do not know the concept of sex because he have to spend a lot of time suffer from that situation and I corrupt his beautiful mind with the absurd stuff of the sexuality produce by the allo on the web just to feel he safe I m sorry that I try to keep he do that while I m write this but I just want to set he free from other uncomfortable feeling and you overall I believe maybe these thought of sex would set he free from think so deep and so much but it never do so maybe I should quit do that poor he he experience a pain yet again because of his fissure which show itself from time to time I wish I could please enjoy it system I beg you I try so hard to end our struggle as a whole okay I will give up at least for now or I do not ohanyway I will stop system I do not want to upset you even more make he enjoy it or maybe I will not because I do not know how to stop it anymore maybe I will never able to oh poor you I wish I could make you enjoy this pain a little bit it will come back later even if it pass for now also he struggle to have a connection with the man he want to share a life with so I think I could help and I still want to believe I can helpim sorry I will not stop until he submit to I because I love he so much and I will not let he suffer more so here you go system I m already trigger you I should also collaborate with you to make he finger himself and goon a lot yes let give he an erection he need it oh yes let give a background of some fucking noise yes corrupt his minddont stop yes that s other man call real sex so let have he feel at least a similar feeling which he never will feel unfortunately please stop make he struggle a little bit more cmon he should be happy we try our good to follow that path maybe he can be happy even fake it he do not stop it you have be do it for year I know but nothing come out of our hand other than this because you choose the easy way not the easy its actually very difficult come on that anus trigger alter make he feel it more we should make he feel happy which you can not we should we love he so much I just want he to live happily not care about anything else the society and authority suck they just want to make he conform to strict rule even if they re not for his good he can not communicate himself he struggle a lot he can not think clearly so he can not function they expect so much from he at the same time they re inconsistentthey call wrong what at some point they claim to be right and right they once they claim to be so so wrong be not it because there be so many of we if we could merge somehow to build his real identity but I think we should die before the real identity resurrect what if also he die that s what I be most scared of I wish I could hug he to make he safe I wish I could too we all want to hug you the system I wish I could kiss his lip hug he hard and say I will be there for he say he s so beautiful to show how much I love he because those man will always hurt he and enjoy touch of course only with my hand and kiss his body to show he how I love he so much and do all forever but the reflection of man do not so what should he continue to worship the disgusting genitalia and anus of they as you ask he to do yes because that would help he feel normal in a safe way what if its not normal well though I agree that I bring to a point where everything become too extreme there be no other way to suppress all the pain he have to face I wish I could kiss he too and say everything will pass I sometimes want to say fuck man because they be of no value but you know I want to make he feel normal and its just I can not manage so I try hard with different strategy you know before goone I also try piss other weird stuff other than scat because the more I could make he suspect his wellbeing make he believe he also enjoy what he call unacceptable by any mean and the society then he have to buckle under and stop care about the society and their construct absurd problem while they should instead discuss our reason of existence the world as a whole do research more let he also start somewhere without distract he with you can not do you can not understand they always make he struggle mock his potential and burnout they play out with his inability to distinguish joke from reality they hate he so much they reject he they will never accept he to the society these all do not justify your behaviour well I know my strategy be wrong but he also struggle understand the reason behind his attraction to man he reject it some alter intervene and make he lose interest to man I bring he to this place back if he still feels attract to man despite that what most man in his life do to he its because of I even if I corrupt his mind I do for his good yes we all do so as the team of corruption if this be what you want to call we and we do not regret we do not regret even if you will call we satan man be not because be also scared of satan we just want he our system to feel safe and be let down by the society one more time he will not be able to tolerate it I know this be sad but our system be too kind for other people to let he live among they you know other alter you try so hard to make he conform with the standar in other aspect but in the end he abandon they one by one because he never feel like do those thing he just desire what he s not capable of due to his inherent problem his learning disability and our ancestor he gradually lose his capability to do those I believe these capability be still there why be you do this because he get so tired of everything so easily not easily you do not allow he to train himself to try hard he actually do indeed but it somehow always end with suffering because the system be a perfectionist actually one of our colleague be unfortunately that s the harsh bitter truth he will not let he live let just shut up and let the system finish the post so that he can share on reddit with other people struggle with have the altersvoice like we they will reject help he because they re also part of society that s painfully true so sorry for be not able to write a tldr right now I feel so combust for that I hope you can bear to read I m genuinely and frankly sorry if I also

1jm5zgt,1743196809.0,you need therapy I m sure this have be talk about before but oh my gosh I m so over how the response to everything be that people need therapy I think its great that therapy have become normalize and accept however my response to this be who be go to pay for this therapy who be go to find a therapist that actually fit with my need and value or anyone else who be go to make sure that therapist be be pay fairly for their service while also make those service affordable I feel like this phrase have just become a way for people to dismiss what people say like oh I do not care go talk to a therapist for example I have a fester resentment towards my parent because they be abusive judgmentally wow you need therapy but that s not an option for everyone especially the people who really need it I know people who be traumatize so bad or be chronically ill so they can not work consistently or if they re in an abusive environment therapy be completely off the table and not to mention the amount of harm a bad therapist can do I m sorry but even in instance that therapy be an option it might not be the solution or at least not talk therapy even therapist admit that a lot of client come in talk about world event like climate change capitalism etc and that s not really something anyone can fix on their own I mean what be you suppose to do learn to breathe yeah you can work on mindset blah blah blah and I m sure it help but seriously what s with this mentality that all anybody need be therapy admittedly I see this mostly online but I think its still harmful its especially fuck if you have cptsd tldr I m just so over the response to see people struggle be this dismissive and judgmental mindset of just get therapy edit yes its fine to have thoughtful conversation with people who need therapy about get therapy yes its fine to establish boundary and point people to go in the right direction to heal and no I m not lump all therapist into one if I m

incredible and I believe anyone who have the resource should try it I can see how if I do not have health insurance and someone say that to I i d get even more upset it be frustrating and those feeling be very valid even try to find a good therapist when you have the resource can be really frustrating all we can do be take care of ourselves as good we can any comment from outsider be often

unfairness I start with session one a month people try to find different way like self help books inner child work which I do not know of back then it be indeed a journey to find the right therapist and it can take a long time its not easy but live with cptsd with no professional support be bad I would expect if a client come to a therapist talk about world event for the therapist to understand
